RHODES-MOORHOUSE VC COMMEMORATION
First World War Hero Remembered
In April 2015 residents of Spratton remembered a young man who was awarded the Victoria Cross for conspicuous bravery on 26th April 1915.\u00a0 Lt William Rhodes-Moorhouse VC RFC lived in the village before the First World War and was well-known for his fast motorcars and his exciting, new flying machines.
One hundred years after the flight that earned him the country\u2019s highest award for bravery, an official memorial stone to Lt William Rhodes-Moorhouse VC was placed in the Millennium Garden on the Brixworth Road in Spratton and unveiled by the Lord Lieutenant for Northamptonshire, Mr David Laing. A group of today\u2019s airmen from No 2 Squadron from RAF Lossiemouth travelled from Scotland especially to be present and formed a standard party to pay tribute to their former colleague. The band of Northampton\u2019s Air Training Corps led the procession from the church and a young ATC bugler played the Last Post.\u00a0 The Bishop of Brixworth, the Right Reverend John Holbrook and the Rector of the Uplands Group of parishes, the Reverend Chris Peck, conducted a service of remembrance in St Andrew\u2019s Church, Spratton.
The proceedings were organised by Spratton Local History Society and supported by Northamptonshire County Council, Daventry District Council and the Daventry District Housing Community Chest. Photographs by the Spratton Photography\u00a0Group.
