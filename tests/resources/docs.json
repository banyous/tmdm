    "title": "Intrauterine virus infections and congenital heart disease",
    "abstract": "The etiologic basis for the vast majority of cases of congenital heart disease remains largely undefined. Viruses have been considered to be likely candidates since the recognition of the association between intrauterine rubella and congenital heart disease. Although the pathogenesis of cardiovascular defects is poorly understood, information gained from the study of congenital rubella syndrome suggests that mechanisms such as focal endothelial cell damage, resulting in obliteration of vascular supply, decreased growth rate, and shortened survival time of certain cells, and disturbed DNA replication in cells whose chromosomes were damaged secondary to the effects of virus replication may be operative in the production of defects in the developing fetus. In addition to rubella there is suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence that Coxsackie B3 and B4 virus infections during pregnancy can result in the birth of infants with a variety of types of congenital heart lesions and that intrauterine mumps virus infection may be etiologically related to the postnatal development of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). Although there are a number of other viruses that are potential etiologic agents of congenital heart disease, the current status of information is inadequate to allow even suggestive associations to be made. The most profitable areas for future investigation appear to be: (1) the epidemiology of congenital heart disease, (2) prospective studies of the association of maternal viral infection with abnormal offspring, (3) the in-depth virologic investigation of the infant with a cardiac defect, and (4) the development of experimental animal models of congenital heart disease. Successful control of virus-induced congenital heart disease will depend on the results of these investigations and the development of vaccines against the identified causative viruses and\/or safe and effective antiviral chemotherapy for the woman in early gestation who is infected with a known teratogenic agent."

    "abstract": "Middle-aged female identical twins, one of whom had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), were evaluated for immunologic reactivity to previous antigenic challenges, including primary immunization with a foreign antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). These two women had lived together for all of their 58 years and neither was receiving anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs at the time of these studies. Both twins demonstrated comparable 7S and 198 humoral antibody response to KLH, as well as similar viral antibody titers. However, the twin with SLE was anergic to common antigens, streptokinase-streptodornase, Trichophyton and Candida; furthermore delayed hypersensitivity to KLH did not develop after immunization. This observed discrepancy between humoral and cellular immunity in genetically similar subjects may be significant in the pathogenesis of SLE."

    "title": "Epidemiology of community-acquired respiratory tract infections in adults Incidence, etiology, and impact",
    "abstract": "Upper respiratory tract infections are the most common types of infectious diseases among adults. It is estimated that each adult in the United States experiences two to four respiratory infections annually. The morbidity of these infections is measured by an estimated 75 million physician visits per year, almost 150 million days lost from work, and more than $10 billion In costs for medical care. Serotypes of the rhinoviruses account for 20 to 30 percent of episodes of the common cold. However, the specific causes of most upper respiratory infections are undefined. Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality for nonhospitalized adults despite the widespread use of effective antimicrobial agents. There are no accurate figures on the number of episodes of pneumonia that occur each year in ambulatory patients. In younger adults, the atypical pneumonia syndrome Is the most common clinical presentation; Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most frequently Identified causative agent. Other less common agents include Legionelia pneumophila, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and Chiamydia. More than half a million adults are hospitalized each year with pneumonia. Persons older than 65 years of age have the highest rate of pneumonia admissions, 11.5 per 1,000 population. Pneumonia ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonlas are changing. Forty years ago, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for the majority of infections. Today, a broad array of community-acquired pathogens have been implicated as etiologic agents Including Leglonella species, gram-negative bacilli, Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and nonbacterial pathogens. Given the diversity of pathogenic agents, it has become imperative for clinicians to establish a specific etiologic diagnosis before initiating therapy or to consider the diagnostic possibilities and treat with antimicrobial agents that are effective against the most likely pathogens."

    "title": "Infectious diarrhea: Pathogenesis and risk factors",
    "abstract": "Our understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious, especially bacterial, diarrhea has increased dramatically. New etiologic agents, mechanisms, and diseases have become known. For example, Escherichia coli serogroup 0157 is now known to cause acute hemorrhagic colitis. Also, E. coli serogroups that produce Shiga toxin are recognized as etiologic agents in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The production of bacterial diarrhea has two major facets, bacterial-mucosal interaction and the induction of intestinal fluid loss by enterotoxins. Bacterial-mucosal interaction can be described in stages: (1) adherence to epithelial cell microvilli, which is often promoted by or associated with pill; (2) close adherence (enteroadherence), usually by classic enteropathogenic E. coli, to mucosal epithelial cells lacking microvilli; and (3) mucosal invasion, as with Shigella and Salmonella infections. Further large strides in understanding infectious diarrhea are likely with the cloning of virulence genes if additional host-specific animal pathogens become available for study."

    "title": "New perspectives on the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis",
    "abstract": "In the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, locally produced antibodies complex with an inciting antigen, yet to be identified, within the joint and activate the complement system, resulting in articular inflammation mediated primarily by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and their products. Chronic inflammatory cells then produce soluble factors that induce both tissue destruction and inflammation. A major issue is how and why apparently normal immune responses in the acute stage progress to chronic inflammation in subsequent months to years. Although it is often assumed that the initial etiologic agent, persisting in the joint or at an extra-articular site, is responsible for continued synovitis, this need not be the case. It is possible that once the inciting agent is cleared from the joint through a normal immune response, the presence of activated cells rich in surface class II histocompatibility (Ia) antigens could, under the influence of multiple genetic or environmental factors, become the target of autoimmune attack. Alternatively, the process might result from the interactions of synovial lining cells and their products with T cells assuming a secondary role. Further research into the relative contributions of soluble products, T helper and suppressor subsets, synoviocytes, and antigen determine which model is correct."

    "abstract": "Acute bronchitis, an illness frequently encountered by primary-care physicians, is an inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree that results from a respiratory tract infection. It is characterized by persistent cough and sputum production and is occasionally accompanied by fever and\/or chest pain. Acute bronchitis may have a viral or bacterial origin and is often treated with antibiotics. Four clinical trials were conducted to compare high and low doses of loracarbef, a new oral \u03b2-lactam antibiotic, with three agents commonly used to treat acute bronchitis: amoxicillin\/clavulanate, cefaclor, and amoxicillin. Results of these studies indicated that loracarbef, 400 and 200 mg twice daily, had clinical and bacteriologic efficacy against the common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis that was comparable with that of the comparative agents. Loracabef was as well tolerated as cefaclor and amoxicillin; moreover, it produced a significantly lower incidence of diarrhea than did amoxicillin\/clavulanate. Loracarbef may be considered a safe and effective alternative agent for the treatment of patients with acute bronchitis."

    "abstract": "An assay for the microsomal hydroxylation of lauric acid (LA), based on HPLC with flow-through radiochemical detection, has been developed. Conditions were optimized for resolution and quantitation of three microsomal metabolites of LA, one of which has not been reported previously as a metabolite of LA in mammalian microsomal incubations. These products, 12-(\u03c9)-hydroxy-LA, 11-(\u03c9-1)-hydroxy-LA, and a novel metabolite, 10-(\u03c9-2)-hydroxy-LA, were isolated by HPLC and identified by gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry. In the presence of NADPH, the formation of all three metabolites was linear with time and microsomal protein concentration. Hydrogen peroxide also supported the microsomal metabolism of LA, although the ratio of metabolites was substantially different than that produced by NADPH-supported microsomes. Several biochemical probes (metyrapone, \u03b1-naphthoflavone, 2-diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride, and 10-undecynoic acid) were used to dissociate the three LA hydroxylase activities. These experiments suggest that the site-specific hydroxylation [\u03c9-, (\u03c9-1)-, (\u03c9-2)-] of LA may be catalyzed by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450."

    "title": "Phospholipid vesicles containing bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase exhibit proton translocating activity in the presence of gramicidin",
    "abstract": "Phospholipid vesicles containing bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COV) were characterized for electron transfer and proton translocating activities in the presence of the mobile potassium ionophore, valinomycin, and the channel-forming ionophore, gramicidin, in order to determine if the ionophores modify the functional properties of the enzyme. In agreement with previous work, incubation of COV with valinomycin resulted in a perturbation of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme aa 3 in the Soret region (430 nm); gramicidin had no effect on the heme aa 3 absorbance spectrum. Different concentrations of the two ionophores were required for maximum respiratory control ratios in COV; 40- to 70-fold higher concentrations of valinomycin were required to completely uncouple electron transfer activity when compared to gramidicin. The proton translocating activity of COV incubated with each ionophore gave a similar apparent proton translocated to electron transferred stoichiometry ( H+ e\u2212 ratio) of 0.66 \u00b1 0.10. However, COV treated with low concentrations of gramicidin (0.14 mg\/g phospholipid) exhibited 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher rates of alkalinization of the extravesicular media after the initial proton translocation reaction than did COV treated with valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin allows more rapid equilibration of protons across the phospholipid bilayer during the proton translocation assay. Moreover, at higher concentrations of gramicidin (1.4 mg\/g phospholipid), the observed H+ e\u2212 ratio decreased to 0.280 \u00b1 0.020, while the rate of alkalinization increased an additional 2-fold, suggesting that at higher concentrations, gramicidin acts as a proton ionophore. These results support the hypothesis that cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-linked proton pump that operates at similar efficiencies in the presence of either ionophore. Low concentrations of gramicidin dissipate the membrane potential in COV most likely by a channel mechanism that is different from the carrier mechanism of valinomycin, yet does not make the phospholipid bilayer freely permeable to protons."

A pattern of emergence of higher molecular weight forms was observed. By using a cleavable cross-linker, aminopeptidase N was shown to cross-link both to itself and to its breakdown products as well as to dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Using this technique it was possible to identify three of the breakdown products as 45 kDa, 66 kDa and 95 kDa peptides. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was used to define the precise cleavage points for the bovine renal aminopeptidase N breakdown products. The short amino acid sequences obtained show strong sequence similarity with the human intestinal and rat kidney aminopeptidase N."

Inhibition of enzymatic activities, and western blots of native enzyme and denatured subunits revealed different behaviors of individual antibodies towards the antigen. Two classes of monoclonal antibodies are inhibitory of NADH and methyl viologen nitrate reductase activities, but only one affects also NADH cytochrome c reductase activity. The associated epitopes are sensitive to antigen conformation. Among the 4 other classes, one is specific for the native conformation of the molecule, another binds more strongly to the denatured antigen, and two recognize equally well the two forms."

    "abstract": "Dieldrin (36 mg\/kg body weight) administered intraperitoneally prolonged recovery from infection with mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) in the genetically-resistant A\/J strain, affected the humoral anti-MHV3 IgG immune response, and inhibited the intrinsic antiviral activity of peritoneal macrophages upon in vitro rechallenge with the virus. Infection of untreated A\/J animals and vehicle controls with MHV3 resulted in marked and reproducible activation of peritoneal macrophages, observed in vitro as resistance to MHV3-cytopathic effects 48 hr after rechallenge with the virus, whereas exposure to dieldrin resulted in apparent loss of the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict replication of MHV3 and to protect them from cytolysis. In addition, in vitro treatment of MHV3 virus-activated macrophages with dieldrin, mitomycin C and X-irradiation, inhibited the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict MHV3 replication. This mechanism of cellular restriction of the virus by MHV3-activated macrophages from the resistant A\/J strain appeared to be one of the sensitive targets for the suppressive action of dieldrin on host resistance, as (i) no major changes in macrophage cellular parameters were observed in in vitro studies of cell viability, adherence to plastic, and Superoxide anion generation; (ii) the increased cell yield in the peritoneal exudates during MHV3 virus infection was not affected by dieldrin exposure; and (iii) the attachment and uptake of [3H]MHV3 by virus-activated macophages was shown to be unchanged by dieldrin exposure."

The target enzyme of C-Cyd is supposed to be CTP synthetase that converts UTP to CTP. In keeping with this assumption are the observations that (i) C-Cyd effects a dose-dependent inhibition of RNA synthesis in both virus-infected and uninfected cells, and (ii) exogenous addition of either Urd or Cyd reverses both the antiviral and cytocidal activity of C-Cyd, whereas addition of dThd or dCyd fails to do so. The selectivity of C-Cyd against Sindbis, vesicular stomatitis and reo virus is markedly increased when C-Cyd is combined with Cyd (10 \u03bcg\/mL).

The HAG derivatives [RCH\ue5fbNNHC(\ue5fbNH)NHOH-tosylate] studied could be grouped as; (1) hydroxy-benzylidines; (2) methoxybenzylidines; and (3) nitrobenzylidines substituted at the R position. 2\u2032-Hydroxybenzylidine-HAG, the lead compound, was relatively active in both HT-29 cells and L1210 cells (20 \u00b1 5 and 13 \u00b1 4 \u03bcM for 50% inhibition of HT-29 and L1210 cell growth respectively). The monohydroxybenzylidene compounds were generally more active than the dihydroxy- and trihy-droxybenzylidene-HAG derivatives. The methoxybenzylidene-HAGs were as active as the monohy-droxybenzylidene-HAGs. 2\u2032-Hydroxy-4\u2032-methoxybenzylidene-HAG was much more active than 2\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxybenzylidene-HAG. The mononitrobenzylidene-HAGs were more active than the dinitro-benzylidene-HAG compound. In general, L1210 cells were more sensitive to the effects of the HAG compounds than were HT-29 cells. There was good agreement between the concentration of drug required to inhibit the growth of HT-29 cells and that required to inhibit the growth of L1210 cells. There was also good correlation between the ability of HAG derivatives to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase activity and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Some derivatives, such as 2\u2032,3\u2032,4\u2032- and 3\u2032,4\u2032,5\u2032-trihydroxybenzylidene-HAG inhibited L1210 cell growth by 50% at lower concentrations (7.8 and 11.9 \u03bcM respectively) than the concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of HT-29 cell growth (196 and 234 \u03bcM respectively) and ribonucleotide reductase activity (122 and 188 \u03bcM respectively). The studies of nucleic acid synthesis in L1210 cells using [3H]cytidine as a precursor showed that 2\u2032,3\u2032,4\u2032-trihy-droxybenzylidine-HAG inhibited DNA synthesis at a lower concentration (29 \u03bcM for 50% inhibition) than was needed for the inhibition of RNA synthesis and formation of [3H]deoxycytidine nucleotides in the acid-soluble fraction (320 and 820 \u03bcM for 50% inhibition respectively). These results indicate that 2\u2032,3\u2032,4\u2032-trihydroxybenzylidine-HAG inhibits DNA synthesis in L1210 cells through other mechanisms rather than exclusively through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase activity."

Ce-Cyd is a more potent antiviral agent than its saturated counterpart, cyclopentylcytosine (carbodine, C-Cyd). Ce-Cyd also has potent cytocidal activity against a number of tumor cell lines. The putative target enzyme for both the antiviral and antitumor action of Ce-Cyd is assumed to be the CTP synthetase that converts UTP to CTP. In keeping with this hypothesis was the finding that the antiviral and cytocidal effects of Ce-Cyd are readily reversed by Cyd and, to a lesser extent, Urd, but not by other nucleosides such as dThd or dCyd. In contrast, pyrazofurin and 6-azauridine, two nucleoside analogues that are assumed to interfere with OMP decarboxylase, another enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, potentiate the cytocidal activity of Ce-Cyd. Ce-Cyd should be further pursued, as such and in combination with OMP decarboxylase inhibitors, for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of both viral and neoplastic diseases."

Amastatin and probestin were effective against all three aminopeptidases, with the concentration of inhibitor required to cause 50% inhibition (I50) in the low micromolar range (I50 = 1.5\u201320 \u03bcM), except for probestin with AP-N which displayed an I50 of 50 nM. Actinonin failed to inhibit significantly either AP-A or AP-W, and thus can be considered a relatively selective inhibitor (I50 = 2.0 \u03bcM of AP-N. In contrast, bestatin was a relatively poor inhibitor of AP-N (I50 = 89 \u03bcm) and failed to inhibit AP-A, but was more potent towards AP-W (I50 = 7.9 \u03bcM). Thus, some of the observed chemotherapeutic actions of bestatin may be due to inhibition of cell-surface AP-W. A number of other metallopeptidase inhibitors, including inhibitors of endopeptidase-24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) and membrane dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.11), and the carboxylalkyl and phosphoryl inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) failed to inhibit significantly AP-A, AP-N or AP-W. However, AP-W was inhibited with I50 values in the micromolar range by the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors rentiapril (I50 = 1.6 \u03bcM), zofenoprilat (I50 = 7.0 \u03bcM) and YS 980 (I50 = 17.7 \u03bcM). Neither AP-A nor AP-N were affected by these sulphydryl compounds. Inhibition of AP-W may account for some of the side effects noted with the clinical use of the sulphydryl converting enzyme inhibitors. The availability of compounds which are totally selective for AP-W over any of the other mammalian cell surface zinc aminopeptidases may aid in identifying endogenous substrates, and thus physiological or pathophysiological role(s) of AP-W."

Fast transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein arriving at the optic nerve terminals (superior colliculus) of the SFV-infected mice prior to the onset of demyelination. In contrast, the slow transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein at the superior colliculus of the SFV-infected mice during the demyelination period. There was no concomitant increase in labelled protein in the retina at any time after the SFV infection. It is proposed that alteration in the transport of the protein constituents other than major myelin specific components may cause disruption of myelin maintenance in SFV infection."

Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation, enhanced both the normal and TPA-induced proliferation of astrocytes. Authentic prostaglandin E2 blocked this effect of indomethacin and also partially blocked the effect of TPA, suggesting that the intracellular mechanisms involved in prostaglandin E2-regulated astrocyte growth might differ from those acting in protein kinase-dependent growth. The effect of prostaglandin E2 was blocked by a specific anti-prostaglandin E2 polyclonal antibody. Cultured astrocytes and microglia produced and released prostaglandin E2 in response to stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide, TPA, and lymphokines. Since the sensitivity of astrocytes and microglia to these stimuli was different, prostaglandin E2 may differentially regulate astrocyte proliferation under different physiological conditions, acting in an autocrine fashion for astrocytes and in a paracrine fashion for microglia."

    "title": "Polarity of processes with Golgi apparatus in a subpopulation of type I astrocytes",
    "abstract": "The Golgi apparatus-complex (GA), is a key organelle involved in several posttranslational modifications of polypeptides destined for lysosomes, plasma membranes and secretion. As reported from this laboratory, certain astrocytes in rat brain contain cisternae of the GA not only in perikarya, but also in processes. In order to further investigate which type of astrocytes contain GA in processes we conducted the present study using primary cultures of rat astrocytes and organelle specific antibodies against the GA and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). While the perikarya of all cells contained elements of the GA, only a single process of a subset of type I astrocytes, negative to antibodies A2B5 and HNK-1, contained GA. In contrast, elements of the RER were found within perikarya and all processes. In order to confirm that the immunostained structures in processes indeed represent the GA, we exposed cultures to Brefeldin A (BFA), a secretion blocker which disperses the GA and redistributes it to the RER. We observed that BFA disrupted the GA of both perikarya and processes. However, astrocytes were resistant to prolonged incubations with BFA, while a similar treatment killed cultured fibroblasts and PC-12 cells. Furthermore, in astrocytes exposed to BFA for several days, the delicate network of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was replaced by large perinuclear masses of the protein. These observations demonstrate that a subset of type I astrocytes have a single process with elements of the GA. We suggest that this specialization of the GA may be related to yet unrecognized secretory or protein processing functions of these cells. The resistance of astrocytes to BFA and the striking changes in their cytoskeleton induced by the drug, may contribute to studies on the mechanism(s) of action of BFA."

    "title": "Selective induction of interleukin-6 in mouse microglia by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor",
    "abstract": "Astrocytes produce granulocyte\/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and support the survival and proliferation of microglia. To study the functions of GM-CSF in the central nervous system (CNS), we examined the effects of GM-CSF on cytokine production by glial cells. GM-CSF induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by microglia, but not by astrocytes, in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by bioassay and the detection of IL-6 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. GM-CSF did not induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a or IL-1 in microglia and astrocytes, whereas lipopolysaccharide induced all these cytokines. The induction of IL-6 by GM-CSF in microglia was completely inhibited by antibodies to GM-CSF. Neither IL-3 nor macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) induced IL-6 production in microglia. Given that IL-1 and TNF\u03b1, monokines derived from microglia, induce IL-6 production in astrocytes, but not in microglia, results indicate that astrocytes and microglia may mutually regulate IL-6 production by different cytokines."

    "abstract": "Faeces are not always uniform in consistency. Many owners believe that variations in faecal consistency are abnormal, but consistency may vary during one evacuation, i.e. initially firm but latterly soft, or over the day, e.g. the initial morning faeces are frequently firmer than those passed later in the day. It is normal for a dog to defaecate more than twice daily. The accepted range of normality for the dog and cat is one to four times daily although this depends on the diet. The faecal output of a dog fed on a dry, complete diet may be twice that on a meat-based diet. The addition of dog biscuit to the meat has little effect upon faecal bulk as most biscuit is low in fibre."

A serological survey showed antibodies to the virus to be present in 31% of pigs tested, and reactors were detected on 43% of farms sampled."

    "abstract": "Published reference ranges for blood biochemistry in swine generally do not relate to sows in modern breeding units, and results were often obtained by methods that are now outdated. The ranges widely used in clinical practice reflect these inappropriate sources. The data presented here were obtained using modern methods of analysis on blood samples from healthy, conventionally managed sows from six breeding herds of known disease status in eastern England, and thus represent appropriate ranges for this class of swine. The values differ from earlier reports principally in higher values for total bilirubin, creatine kinase, and more particularly of total plasma and serum proteins. The latter are shown to be due to higher immunoglobulin concentrations than those previously reported."

Clinical signs of infection in horses vary widely and severe infection can lead to pregnant mares aborting. Infected horses generally make good recoveries but stallions may become semen shedders of equine arteritis virus (EAV). These carrier stallions play an important role in the dissemination and perpetuation of EAV. Laboratory tests exist to detect virus and the equine immune response to infection. However, vaccines are not currently licensed in the UK to combat viral arteritis, the incidence of which may increase due to changes in European legislation."

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) and a number of related distinctive diseases are characterized by the active degradation of central nervous system (CNS) myelin, an axonal sheath comprised essentially of proteins and lipids. These demyelinating diseases appear to arise from complex interactions of genetic, immunological, infective, and biochemical mechanisms. While circumstances of MS etiology remain hypothetical, one persistent theme involves recognition by the immune system of myelin-specific antigens derived from myelin basic protein (MBP), the most abundant extrinsic myelin membrane protein, and\/or another equally susceptible myelin protein or lipid component. Knowledge of the biochemical and physical\u2014chemical properties of myelin proteins and lipids, particularly their composition, organization, structure, and accessibility with respect to the compacted myelin multilayers, thus becomes central to the understanding of how and why these antigens become selected during the development of MS. This review focuses on current understanding of the molecular basis underlying demyelinating disease as it may relate to the impact of the various protein and lipid components on myelin morphology; the precise molecular architecture of this membrane as dictated by protein\u2014lipid and lipid\u2014lipid interactions; and the relationship, if any, between the protein\/lipid components and the destruction of myelin in pathological situations."
